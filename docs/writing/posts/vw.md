!!! warning "Vowpal Wabbit is a great tool"

    I takes some time to understand and use it properly. This post is about my journey with Vowpal Wabbit and the lessons I learned from it.

Hey everyone!

So, for the last couple of years, I've been working with [@Vowpal Wabbit](https://vowpalwabbit.org/) (VW) and messing around with contextual bandit algorithms in Python. I've gotta say, VW is pretty awesome at what it does and it seems like everyone who's into bandits is using it. But man, trying to figure it out has been a bit of a headache—the docs are super sparse, and there are all these little quirks and half-baked features.

Being in the trenches, I've picked up a bunch of insights and face-palm moments that I wish someone had told me about from the start. What I'm sharing here is all the stuff that's made a difference for me while I've been working with VW. I'm hoping it'll make your life a bit easier too because, despite the pain, VW is kind of a hidden gem once you get it up and running.

This post is mainly about the Python side of things but if you're more of a command-line wizard, you'll probably find it useful too, since the Python part is just a front for the command line. I've been playing with the `--cb_explore_adf` setting a ton, which is this super intricate and under-explained feature, but it's also super powerful for bandits. It lets you shuffle through actions and their features in a flexible way. That's what I’m focusing on here, but if you're using VW for other bandit stuff, stick around—you'll find some useful tips regardless.

If you catch any goofs or if something seems off in what I’ve shared, drop me a comment. I’m all about learning and improving, so I’ll keep updating this post as I get smarter.
